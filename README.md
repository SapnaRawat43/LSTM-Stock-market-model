# LSTM-Stock-market-model
This project is a web app that predicts stock price trends using historical data. Users enter a stock ticker, start date, and end date. The app fetches the data, visualizes it, and applies an LSTM model to predict future prices. It then displays evaluation metrics and provides investment advice based on the predictions.
